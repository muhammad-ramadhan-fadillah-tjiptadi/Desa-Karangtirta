A combobox is an input field combined with a list of options. People set its value by typing, by choosing an option from the listbox, or both.

These criteria apply to every editable, single-select combobox, written for the common case of a listbox. Pick the variant below and apply this file together with the variant's file; the grid popup and date picker variants state which listbox criteria they replace.

For a select-only combobox (no text entry, but type-ahead moves focus to the first option starting with the typed character), see Acceptance Criteria: Select

### Choosing a variant

Autocomplete behaviour (how options respond to typing). This base file is already loaded; also load the variant file(s) in the **Load** column, in order:

| Variant | Use when | Load |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Combobox (no autocomplete) | Options are independent of the typed text: recent searches, popular picks, a fixed shortlist. | `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (no autocomplete).md` |
| Combobox (list autocomplete) | Default. Typing filters the list; nothing commits until the user chooses. Its "With automatic selection" section covers committing the top match on blur, for example airport codes. | `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (list autocomplete).md` |
| Combobox (list and inline autocomplete) | Power-user speed with predictable values, such as browser-style URL completion. The most complex variant. | `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (list autocomplete).md`, then `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (list and inline autocomplete).md` |

Popup type (independent of the above): a flat listbox is the default and needs nothing extra.

| Popup | Load |
| --- | --- |
| Grid of options, where each needs extra columns such as a name plus a category | `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (list autocomplete).md`, then `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (grid popup).md` |
| Calendar dialog for a date | `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Combobox (date picker).md`, plus `references/acceptance-criteria/Acceptance Criteria - Modal Dialog.md` |
